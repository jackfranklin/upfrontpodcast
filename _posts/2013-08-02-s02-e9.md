This week there's no Ben unfortunately but guest Michael Heap steps up to talk about his extensive work with Node.js. We discuss how to get started with Node, which modules make their way into our toolkit and how we find working in Node. If you've been putting off Node, this episode and the notes below should be a good excuse to get started.
