This week we caught up with developer Andy Appleton to talk about testing, specifically JavaScript testing. We cover the difference between TDD and BDD, Unit Tests vs Integration Tests, automated testing, our favourite libraries, and a lot more. If you're interested in testing your JavaScript, you really should give this a listen.
