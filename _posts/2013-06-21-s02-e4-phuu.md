This week [Tom Ashworth](http://twitter.com/phuunet) jumped infront of the microphone and became our first guest to be recorded through Google Hangouts. We enjoyed it and we're probably going to use it from now on, which means in the future we should be able to live stream!

Tom is a talented JavaScript developer so we picked his mind about AngularJS and some of the side projects he works on which are well worth your time.
