Welcome to Upfront Podcast! In this short episode, we introduce ourselves, our aims for the podcast and talk a little about Heisenberg, an open source project we've both been working on recently. This show is around 15 minutes, although we'll typically be aiming for 30 minutes once we add a guest to the equation. Any feedback, topic or guest suggestions, drop us a tweet!

iTunes link will be up soon, too.
