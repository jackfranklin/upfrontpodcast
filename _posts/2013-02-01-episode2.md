In Episode 2 of Upfront Podcast we chat with JavaScript and Backbone expert Derick Bailey about the merits of using Backbone for JavaScript applications. We also chat about Marionette, Derick's own set of tools that provide a lot of the boilerplate code typically associated with Backbone.

It's a pretty JavaScript-heavy podcast in which we discuss the use cases in which Backbone is a good fit, when perhaps it's not, and good resources to get you started. Next week we'll be talking CSS layouts.

And we are now [on iTunes!](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/upfront-podcast/id598389212).
