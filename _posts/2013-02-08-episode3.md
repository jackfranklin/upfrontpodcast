In our 3rd episode we catch up with developer Phil Nash to talk about CSS Layouts and what's hopefully going to be available to us down the road. Phil explains why floats are not the best resource for layouts and we chat about displaying elements as tables in CSS, Flexbox and Microsoft's attempt, CSS Grids.
